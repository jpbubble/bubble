# Please note before you post an issue!

This engine is basically only a bit of "glue code" allowing you to create an executable program.
Most of the "money" is in [this repository](https://github.com/jpbubble/game), yeah even platform specific things.

Therefore it may be recommendable to use the issue tracker there in stead of this one, unless you are 100% sure the issue is caused in this code!
